A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Regenerate Image from a Reduce Scaled Image Using Bit Data Count

Small scaled image lost some important bits of information which cannot be recovered when scaled back. Using multi-objective genetic algorithm, we can recover these lost bits. In this paper, we described a genetic algorithm approach to recover lost bits while image resized to the smaller version using the original image data bit counts which are stored while the image is scaled. This method is very scalable to apply in a distributed system. Also, the same method can be applied to recover error bits in any types of data blocks. In this paper, we showed proof of concept by providing the implementation and results.
